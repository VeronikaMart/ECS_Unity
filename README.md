# ECS_Unity
Entity Component System (ECS) is a way of writing code that provides high performance by default.

- Entity ("Things", they dont do anything just exist, equivalent of GameObject);   
- Component ("Data", no logic or behavior, belongs to an entity like MonoBehaviours belong to a GameObject);   
- System ("Behavior", not attached to any entity, queries only data that are needed).
